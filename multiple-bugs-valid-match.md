# Test Multiple Bugs: Valid Complete Match

This PR tests bidirectional validation with multiple bugs that properly match.

According to the enhanced bidirectional validation, this should pass because:
- The title mentions BUG5555, BSC-999, and ATLAS-111
- The trailer properly references BUG5555, BSC-999, and ATLAS-111
- All bugs match between title and trailer in both directions

This tests successful bidirectional validation with multiple bugs.

Fixes: BUG5555 BSC-999 ATLAS-111
