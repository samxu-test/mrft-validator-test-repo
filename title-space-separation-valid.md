# Test Title Space Separation: Valid Match

This PR tests bidirectional validation with space-only separation in title (no commas).

According to the enhanced bidirectional validation, this should pass because:
- The title uses space separation: BUG2020 BSC-606 ATLAS-707
- All bugs have corresponding Fixes trailers
- Both directions validate correctly

This tests title format flexibility with space-only separation.

Fixes: BUG2020 BSC-606 ATLAS-707
