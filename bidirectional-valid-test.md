# Test Bidirectional Validation: Valid Match

This PR tests the scenario where title and trailer properly match.

According to the enhanced bidirectional validation, this should pass because:
- The title mentions BUG6666
- The trailer properly references BUG6666
- Both directions validate correctly

This tests successful bidirectional validation.

Fixes: BUG6666
